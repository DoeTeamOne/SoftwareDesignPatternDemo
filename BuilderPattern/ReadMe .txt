it is Creational pattern of GOF

we use this pattern when we wanto to make algorithm for creating complex object independent of the parts that makes up the object and how they are assembled 

and 
 when you want to construction process to allow diffrent reperesentation for the object that's constructed!!


 Pattern Results
 - it lets us vary a products internal reperesentations
 - it isolate code for construction and representation so improve modularity (single Responsiblity Priciple achived)
 - it gaves us finer  cntrol over the construction processs
 -complexity of your codebase is increased
