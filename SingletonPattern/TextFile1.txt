is A creational Pattern of GOF

the intent of this pattern is to ensure that the class has only one instance  and provide globall access to it ss

a greate good example is A logger 


use cases 
whene there must be exactly one instance of the class and it must be accessible to client  from a well knowen access point


pattern Results

- strict control over how and when client Access it 
- it avoid polutiong the namespace with dlobal variables 
-subclassing allows configuring the application with an instane of the class that you need at runtime
- it violate single responsiblility principle  because objects not only control how thry are created but also manage thirer own lifecycle 

nb .. this implementation might not be used in a modern programing since this is the IOC container take care of this
